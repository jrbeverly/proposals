# Proposals

Experimenting with the underlying infrastructure for a GitHub based proposals mechanisms that deploys to a web resource (website/subpage/etc)

## Motivations

- Automation to ensure contribution guidelines are both accessible and followed (e.g. first contribution bot, linting)
- Contribution previews, either by links to markdown rendering or branch previews
- Support for supplemental resources (e.g. `assets/list-of-items.csv`)
- Methods to organize the proposals better (date? slugs? IDs?)
- Simple layout in code (minimal overhead), with tooling to move assets into the correct locations
- Minimal barriers when trying to write a proposal
